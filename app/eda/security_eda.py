# TODO:
# - Write an EDA for the security data where we can describe the dataset state and perform some basic operations
# to clean the data according to specific conventions (e.g. remove rows with missing values, remove duplicates, etc.)
# as well as converting the time data to a more readable format.
# - Specify the columns that we want to use for the model and explain why we chose them.
# - Specify the visualizations that we want to use to describe the data and explain why we chose them.
