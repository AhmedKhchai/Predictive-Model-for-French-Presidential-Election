Based on the historical data of the 2017 presidential French election we would like to create a prediction model that would be trained on the 2017 election data as well a few other datasets concerning employment and security. The datasets need to be per each French department. The goal is to predict the outcome of the 2022 based on the employment and security datasets of 2022 
**Tasks**:
	Help find adequate (elections-employment-security) datasets for the 2017 and 2022
	Plan step to build and train my model based on the 2017 datasets and compare the output to the 2022 datasets
