## Project Description

Based on the historical data of the 2017 presidential French election we would like to create a prediction model that would be trained on the 2017 election data as well a few other datasets concerning employment and security. The datasets need to be per each French department. The goal is to predict the outcome of the 2022 based on the employment and security datasets of 2022 
**Tasks**:
	Help find adequate (elections-employment-security) datasets for the 2017 and 2022
	Plan step to build and train my model based on the 2017 datasets and compare the output to the 2022 datasets  

## EDA

Lets run EDA on the The election dataset of the French Presidential Elections of 2017. The dataset presents a granular view of the voting behaviour across different regions in France, and it includes information about the total number of registered voters, the voter turnout, the number of abstentions, and the votes received by each candidate. It can be used to study the spatial distribution of votes, understand regional political preferences, and analyse voting trends over the two election years.
	**Task:**
		You should give me an overall plan, then we can go through step-by-step. In each step you should write some code and I will run it in the terminal then report back to you the results.

Building a predictive model involves several steps. Given that you've already cleaned and aggregated the datasets, let's outline the process you should follow:

### 1. Data Merging and Exploration:
- **Merging Data**: The datasets you provided are spread over different years and have varying granularity. We'll need to merge these datasets to get a comprehensive view of each department for each year.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use statistical and visualization tools to understand the nature and relationships of the data. Key tasks include:
    - Identifying distributions of variables.
    - Checking for multicollinearity.
    - Correlation analysis between predictors and the target variable.

### 2. Feature Engineering:
- **Feature Creation**: New features might be derived from existing ones. For instance, you might want to calculate the year-on-year change in employment figures or security incidents.
- **Feature Selection**: Not all features might be relevant for the model. Use techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination, correlation matrices, or model-specific feature importances to select the most relevant ones.

### 3. Data Splitting:
- Split your 2017 dataset into training and validation datasets. The training dataset will be used to train the model, while the validation dataset will be used to tune and validate the model's performance.

### 4. Model Building:
- **Model Selection**: Given this is a prediction for election outcomes, regression models or even classification models (if you discretize the target variable) can be suitable. Potential models include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Machines, or Neural Networks.
- **Model Training**: Train your chosen models using the training dataset.

### 5. Model Evaluation:
- **Cross-validation**: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the training data.
- **Metrics**: Depending on whether you're approaching this as a regression or classification problem, you might use metrics like RMSE, MAE, accuracy, F1-score, etc.

### 6. Model Optimization:
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques like grid search or random search to find the best parameters for your model.
- **Feature Importance**: Depending on the model, evaluate the importance of each feature. This can give you insights into what factors most influence election outcomes.

### 7. Predictions:
- Use your trained model to predict the 2022 election results based on the 2022 datasets.
- Compare these predictions to the actual 2022 outcomes to evaluate how well your model did.

### 8. Interpretation and Reporting:
- **Interpret Results**: Understand and interpret the model's predictions in the context of the data.
- **Report Generation**: Document the entire process, from EDA to predictions. Highlight key findings, such as which features were the most influential, any patterns or trends identified, and the accuracy of the predictions.

Let's start by loading all the datasets and merging them based on the common keys (like department codes) for a comprehensive analysis. Shall we?
